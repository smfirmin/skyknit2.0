# Writer dispatch table.
# Controls how the Writer module renders each join type in pattern prose.
# The Writer reads this table to select a rendering mode and template key
# for each join it encounters in the assembled IR.
#
# Rendering modes:
#   inline       — no special block; the writer continues prose naturally
#   instruction  — generates a dedicated instruction block with its own line
#   header_note  — generates a note at the section header for finishing reference
#
# directionality_note: true if the Writer must emit left/right variants
# driven by the handedness annotation on the component (e.g. "left sleeve" vs
# "right sleeve", SSK vs K2tog).

entries:

  - join_type: CONTINUATION
    rendering_mode: inline
    template_key: continuation_inline
    directionality_note: false
    notes: >
      No explicit join instruction needed. The writer continues pattern prose
      without interruption (e.g. "Continue knitting in the round.").

  - join_type: HELD_STITCH
    rendering_mode: instruction
    template_key: held_stitch_block
    directionality_note: true
    notes: >
      Emits: "Place next X sts on holder for [component name]."
      Handedness drives left/right label on the component name.

  - join_type: CAST_ON_JOIN
    rendering_mode: instruction
    template_key: cast_on_join_block
    directionality_note: false
    notes: >
      Emits: "Using [cast_on_method], cast on X sts."
      cast_on_count from the Join object drives X.

  - join_type: PICKUP
    rendering_mode: instruction
    template_key: pickup_block
    directionality_note: true
    notes: >
      Emits: "Pick up and knit X sts along [edge description]."
      Derived stitch count and pickup_direction from the Join object.
      Handedness drives left/right edge label.

  - join_type: SEAM
    rendering_mode: header_note
    template_key: seam_note
    directionality_note: false
    notes: >
      Emits a finishing note at the relevant section header, e.g.
      "You will seam this edge to the sleeve cap when finishing."
      The three-needle bind-off variant (CONDITIONAL) uses template key
      three_needle_block and renders as an instruction block instead.
