# Edge types are the physical boundaries of a component shape.
# Each component has a named set of typed edges — the boundaries the Planner
# populates and the Stitch Fillers must arrive at correctly.
#
# OPEN edges are terminal (cuff, hem, neckline) and carry no join slot.

edge_types:

  - id: CAST_ON
    description: >
      Starting edge where stitches are created. The component begins here.
      Stitches exist but have not yet been worked.
    has_live_stitches: false
    is_terminal: false
    phase_constraint: start
    notes: >
      The cast-on row itself. In a top-down sweater the yoke typically begins
      with a CAST_ON edge at the collar.

  - id: LIVE_STITCH
    description: >
      Active stitches currently on the needle, ready to be transferred,
      held, or continued into the next component.
    has_live_stitches: true
    is_terminal: false
    phase_constraint: any
    notes: >
      The primary boundary type for seamless and held-stitch joins.
      This is the Hamiltonian frontier of the knitting graph — the active
      working boundary at any point in construction.

  - id: BOUND_OFF
    description: >
      Finished edge; all stitches have been bound off. No live stitches remain.
    has_live_stitches: false
    is_terminal: false
    phase_constraint: end
    notes: >
      Used as the source side of PICKUP joins and both sides of SEAM joins.
      Typical in set-in sleeve construction and bottom-up shoulder seams.

  - id: PICKUP
    description: >
      Selvedge or row-end edge from which stitches can be picked up.
      This is a lateral boundary of a component, running along knitted rows
      rather than across them.
    has_live_stitches: false
    is_terminal: false
    phase_constraint: any
    notes: >
      Lateral boundary of a component. Stitches are created from the existing
      fabric structure. Common for button bands (front selvedge) and sleeve
      pickup in bottom-up construction.

  - id: OPEN
    description: >
      Terminal edge with no join. Represents a deliberate open boundary:
      cuff, hem, neckline, or any edge that is left unjoined.
    has_live_stitches: true
    is_terminal: true
    phase_constraint: end
    notes: >
      Has no join slot. May have live stitches (e.g. a cuff worked in the
      round and left on the needle) or not (a hemmed edge). The Planner
      marks terminal edges OPEN; the Writer renders them as pattern endings.
