# Default values for join-owned parameters.
# Keyed by (edge_type_a, edge_type_b, join_type) — same ordering as the
# compatibility table. The Planner may override any default; these are
# starting values only.
#
# cast_on_count is intentionally null: it has no safe default and must
# always be set by the Planner from the shape manifest.
